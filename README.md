Trivial jQuery plugin, `$(root).findIncludeSelf(selector)` is the same as `find(selector)` but includes the subject node itself, if it matches the selector.

Specifically:

    $foo.findIncludeSelf(selector)
    
is shorthand for

    $foo.find(selector).addBack(selector)

# Testing

```
$ bower install
$ npm install
$ npm test
```
